## [Assignment #6]
## [Submission date: 10/17/24]
## Worked with/sources 
* AI search: "how to make for loop to find least frequent number."  Needed a starting point besides 0 to assign my "count" variable.
* Lecture Notes 10/7/24 on Dictionaires
* Lecture Notes 9/11/24 on Strings and f-Strings
* 
## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* long strings can be looped simliar to lists and dictionaires
* continue can work to combine the two for loops to determine most and least frequent numbers - but can easily overcomplicate versus two for loops.
